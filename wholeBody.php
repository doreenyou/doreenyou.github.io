    <h4>Purpose</h4>
		<p>Aiming at the issue of over-usage of smart devices in public spaces instead of interacting personally in the physical world, this two-weeks project used Whole Body Interaction, intending to provoke reflection on self-awareness of social presence in public spaces. After experience prototyping, concept developing and prototype building, some preliminary evaluations were carried out to test how people would react to the design.</p>

    <h4>Approach</h4>    
    <p>The project took a speculative approach at highlighting the issue that people in public spaces indulge in using their smart devices instead of interacting with physical people and objects. Through making people aware of what they are actually leaving behind while spending time on their smart devices, the design intention was to encourage interpersonal interaction in the physical world.</p>
    <h4>Experience prototyping</h4>
    <p>Through acting out the design team could speculate how people experience or feel about such situations. This quick ,zero-cost mocking-up and acting-out exercise allowed the designers to present the experience in a dramatic but informative way.</p>

    <h4>Concept Development</h4>
    <p>Focus was then directed at a specific situation when passengers are waiting for a few minutes on the platform in subway stations to board the next incoming train. The metaphor of when people are using a smart device and connected online, they are disconnected from the “real world”, is orientating the design concept. The effect of graying and pixelating the person’s body image represented the disappearance of social presence from the whole picture. </p>

    <h4>Prototyping</h4>
    <p>We used Microsoft Kinect for Xbox 360, a motion sensing input device, then combined with Cycling 74’s Max/MSP software version 6.1.6 on a Mac environment to develop rich media interaction. A large LCD TV screen was used to simulate the projection on the wall of station.</p>

    <h4>User Tests and Evaluation</h4>
    <p>To evaluate the effect of the design, five user tests have been conducted to gather preliminary feedback. Two individual tests and three group tests had been carried out.</p>
    <p>After participants entered the lab room, they were told to imagine being in the context of a subway station waiting for the next train. They were invited to behave normally and do whatever they like in this simulation. All participants understood that there were certain technologies connecting the screen and people in front of the screen, because they could see their mirroring figures on the screen when they stood in front of it. Most users started to interact with their mirrored figures by performing different body gestures and positions.</p>
    <p>An unexpected result was that participants started to play with adjacent people and the mirroring figures in their own desired way. They formed their own interpretation about the gray-scale and pixelated digital figure. The combination of Kinect and Max/MSP led to certain limitations, for example it cannot accurately detect the gesture when there are more than two people. This however led to some unexpected playful interactions. Two participants twisted and bent their bodies continually trying to trigger the digital transformation. When a group was standing before the screen, they interacted physically, ran around and poked each other as if the trigger was about the interpersonal interactions.</p>
    <p>Yet another issue arose from a shy participant when he did not want to interact in the simulated context at all. Instead, he kept stepping back and forth to avoid seeing himself in the screen. Another user also reflected that if he saw the projection somewhere he would try to avoid appearing on it.</p>
    <p>Even though the user tests would ideally have been carried out in a better context and setup, the conducted tests offered compelling insight. It was obvious, that even though people used it differently than intended, they started interacting with each other and had fun, which was the ultimate objective.</p>
