  	<h2>EHS app - Report incidents, near misses, and safety observations </h2>
    
  	<div class="content">
    <h4>Project goal</h4>
		<p>EHS app enables employees to report an incident, a near miss or a safety observation from their company iPhone. I worked on the redesign of this app.</p>

    <h4>Product strategy</h4>
    <p>I demonstrated the difference of SAP web system and mobile app, in order to convince the project team to only keep the key form fields and remove the redundant info in the EHS app. I simplified the user flow to finish a reporting task, as well as converted web forms to mobile elements. The hard-to-use web form became a simple and immersive mobile experience.</p>

    <h4>User Interface Design</h4> 
    <p>The existing app had various serious issues of usability. I re-designed the UI in Sketch with incremental features to meet business needs without losing good usability.</p>
