  	<h2>Designing for Now or for The Future?</h2>
    <h3>February - May, 2014</h3>
  	<div class="content">
  		<h4>Project Background</h4>
		<p>Navigaid is a 3-years project within the cooperation between multiple stakeholders in design, technology, service and aviation area. The goal was to develop a new airport luggage handling trolley with an embedded tablet.</p>
		<p>My design agenda was on the interaction design between passengers and this new trolley, especially in terms of the software system. I combined product design with design ethnographically inspired fieldwork as my main design research activities.</p>

		<h4>Design activities</h4>

		<h5>Initial studies: to explore the design context and to gain design requirements</h4>
		<h6>Value Network Mapping</h6>
		<p>I mapped out all the stakeholders and value exchange that influence passengers’ experience in the airport to see how the implementation of luggage handling trolley with an informative system would intervene the value flow.</p>

		<h6>Desk research: to gather and to analyse existing empirical data</h6>
		<p>Based on the former research results from 400 surveys through the Internet and 57 interviews in CPH Airport and Keflavik Airport conducted by CPH Inventures, I generated some insights from KJ Method as some implication for the focus of the system design. These implications contributed to the design inspiration and requirements in the later-on prototype design, such as offering a friendly start page, adding some social features, and providing facilities information. </p>

		<h6>Field observation: to study the present signage arrangement</h6>
		<p>For capturing relevant visual accounts as the ethnographic research background, I observed inside the transit area to collect touchpoints (i.e. the places that interaction happens between users and service) evidences for way-finding. </p>

		<h6>Interview: to know about passengers’ purchasing behaviours </h6>
		<p>I conducted interviews inside the design company with employees who had all been traveling through different airports for times, to develop an understanding of their traveling experience in different airports‘ transit area compared to CPH Airport. </p>

		<h5>Artefacts design</h4>
		<p>In order to reveal the human aspect of perceiving this trolley, I decided to go beyond usability engineer scope, using ethnography and design visions to plump design work and to extend the scope for future contexts. </p>
		<h6>Design the present: Prototype the app</h6>
		<p>I built an interactive tablet application, and a connection between the tablet and luggage handling trolley, to test the usability.</p>

		<h3>Tangible Model Prototyping</h3>
		<p>Considered the screen should be easy to use for users with different body shapes and position, the physical height and angle should be adjustable. </p>

		<h6>Design the near-future storyboard</h6>
		<p>To illustrate the future possibilities of product development and provoking participants’ desirability and wishes, I made some sketches of scenarios as a media to discuss with design stakeholders and co-explore with users. </p>

		<h6>Design the vision cards</h6>
		<p>For opening up participants’ imagination and speculating the possible futuristic use practice, I made a set of vision cards containing 12 scenes collage as a far-future design artefact.</p>

		<h5>Fieldwork with design artefacts</h5>
		<p>The user study was done inside the transition area in the airport. By bringing the design to the “real context”, the participants could relate their on-going journey with the design. At last, 15 interviews including 12 individual interviews and 3 group interviews were carried out in 8 days. The age of participants ranged from 23-55 years, with gender equivalence in consideration. Normally passengers didn’t have a long time to participate in the study, so one interview on average lasted for 15-20 minutes. 
Steps of the semi-structure interviews:
1. Introduce the research purpose
2. Get information of the present travel by using a journey map I made for the participants as a self-documentation, so they could write down the details of their journey at each touchpoint. (Usually the journey map is done among the design/research team, but here I used it as an inquiry tool at the beginning for participants to recall their journey from leaving home to waiting for boarding.)
3. Engage informants in the three design artefacts session 
4. Go in depth if needed and permitted</p>

		<h4>Concept Evaluation</h4>
		<p>Based on the ethnographic feedback, I evaluated each concept by considering cons and pros, and users’ comments. </p>

 		<h4>Thesis Publication</h4>
 		<p>Apart from providing empirical evidences on further design practice for this project, the research led to many findings, such as how different qualities of the design artefacts and the order of discussing design artefacts influenced user engagement, how the tensions and dilemmas between product design and design ethnography re-framed the design practice.
