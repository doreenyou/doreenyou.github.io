    <h4>Project goal</h4>
		<p>An internal client wants an app to digitalize the 7 ebooks, so employees can read the training materials on the phone. After finishing reading, there will be some quiz to help user remember the essentials.</p>

    <h4>Interaction Design</h4>    
    <p>Instead of moving all the pdfs directly to a mobile app, which would save lots of development time, I knew we need better reading experiences than a PDF reader. Thus I proposed to make a dedicated app that contains lots of cool micro-animations when navigating between pages. Also, I rejected the client’s propose of using virtual LEGO bricks to motivate users to read more, as gamification makes no sense in such a e-reading app, which would kill the simplicity and work against it.</p>

    <p>I used Principal for Mac to design the animation prototype so the clients could get an idea of how the app would look like. Also, it gives the developers a visualization to discuss upon the praticality.
The prototype can be watched here:</p>
