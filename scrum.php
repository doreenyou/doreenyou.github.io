    <h4>Certificated Scrum Master</h4>
	<p>When the development team started to transform into Agile way of working, I took the responsibility of bringing Scrum knowldge into daily collabration. Thus, I took a certificated Scrum Master course to equip myself with the right knowledge and to share with the team.</p>

    <h4>Product Owner</h4>
    <p>The distributed set up makes the Scrum practice very difficult. After a local Scrum Master onboarded, my role in the Scrum practice was only focused on the quality check of the delivery and organizing product backlog.</p>

    <h4>Scrum Practices</h4>
    <p>I made a product release lifecycle including phase 0 to prepare prototypes, POC, etc before development sprints starts. Also, UX staggered sprints make sure to minimize the timeline conflicts between designer and developers. Last but not least, a hardening sprint before release can ensure final QA sign-off and everything is ready to take off.</p>

    <p>I also made a Scrum practice handbook for the team to look up when in doubt of responsibilities and collabration, as well as to help new team members better adjust to the set up. It's meant to be updated continuously. </p>
