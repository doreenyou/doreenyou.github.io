    <h4>Project Goal</h4>
    <p>Find out the play pattern of Life of George - an augmented reality game app of LEGO through conducting user test among the kids.</p>

    <h4>User test & video analysis</h4>
  		
		<p>We brought 2 iPhones to the local internaltional school, to test with 4 groups of children, ranging from 9 to 11.
Edited Video of User Testing: </p>

    <p>Since kids’ behaviours are very difficult to catch on at the present, especially when they are interacting with a digital screen, we used Burr's Video Cards Method to extract interesting user behaviors from video recordings. Then we sorted all the cards to visualize and organize information in clusters to find the theme and patterns. </p>

    <h4>Further concept development</h4>
    <p>As we found out in the user test, kids tend to stay closely together to be able to see from same side, but it's normally the kid in the middle who operates. So we came up with the idea to make the gameplay more sharing, by using a rotating gameboard.</p>
