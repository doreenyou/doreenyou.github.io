    <h4>Project goal</h4>
		<p>In order to digitalize some of the paper processes, this iPad app needs to enable employees to maintain an internal CV for leadership candidates, as well as to facilitate the succession planning for leadership positions. We didn't have any possibility to do user research, thus the design was based on experts’ experiences and common sense.</p>

    <h4>Interaction Design</h4>    
    <p>By interviewing the domain experts, I learned the entire candidate nomination flow and designed the app accordingly to fit into the current process.</p>

    <h4>One-pager Design</h4> 
    <p>During candidate review meetings, their career profiles would be printed out in A4 format on the wall and be discussed upon. Thus a good design of this one-pager is necessary for a holistic good use experience. Within the technological and strategic limitations, I designed a responsive template of this one-pager so it can work optimal in various scenarios.</p>
