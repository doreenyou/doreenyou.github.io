  	<h2>Sønderborg Welcome Experience</h2>
    <h3>Febrary - May, 2013</h3>
    
  	<div class="content">
		  <p>Aiming to improve newcomers experience in Sønderborg, in this 8-weeks project we used techniques such as “Cultural Probes” to avoid taken-for-granted assumptions and to truly understand the difficulties that newcomers need to face when they come to this new city. Our starting point considers that there is no better way of developing meaningful solutions without inviting the “users” to think and brainstorm together.</p>
      <p>The project counts with two partners-organizations that share interests and thereby cooperate with the team to develop a solution that is, beyond meaningful for the user, possible to be implemented in a short-term time. </p>
      <h4>EXPLORING</h4>
      <p>Different Service Design methods and tools were used to get inspired for coming up with different new ideas or concepts. The methods we used were: story-telling, in which all group members shared their stories of being a newcomer here in Sønderborg. By doing workshops with a variety of users, we developed methods such as personas and customer journey map, so that we could create groups of interests and get some insights and conclusions that could lead us to the following step of creating new concepts.</p>

      <h4>CONCEPTING</h4>
      <p>After using several methods and tools, we came up with four main concepts or ideas that could help to improve the experience of newcomers here in Sønderborg, which is the main goal this project. The mentioned concepts would be a Welcome Kit, a Funny Dictionary, Public Displays and City Explorer.</p>

      <h4>The FINAL Concept</h4>
      <p>The final concept brings an interactive experience via a labyrinth in real scale placed downtown. The analogy was meant to make people find themselves in the Labyrinth of Sønderborg full of interesting and interactive attractions to be found and tried out. It also considers different levels of interaction: for people who will just passed by, notice it but not really interact, for people who want to have a non-committed level of interaction by only writing in the wall outside and finally for those ones who will take some time to get inside, trying new things and meeting new people. </p>
      <p>The labyrinth, so called "Sønderborg Welcome Experience", is composed by 5 thematic rooms made out of game and interactive activities: “Interactive Wall”, “Do it yourself Kit”, “ City Explorer”, “Danish Flavors”, “Danish Language”. The concept of each room intends to merge most of the isolated ideas we presented in the “concept cards”. It also clearly brings back the opportunities we identified when we were conducting cultural probes activities with user. The rooms also provides opportunities to advertise interesting projects happening in the city.ers, the expectations of the partners and provides a meaningful experience to the user.</p>

      <p>Being not only dreamers, we are also practicers. We made this concept real by placing a labyrinth camp at downtown Sønderborg, with many visitors "hygge" together. </p>
